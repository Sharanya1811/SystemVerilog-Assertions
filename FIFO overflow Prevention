Write an assertion to ensure that a FIFO never writes when full. Assume:

wr_en is the write enable signal.
full is the full flag.

Ans:: 
     property fifo_over_prevention;
     @(posedge clock) disable iff(reset)
       (full==1) |-> (wr_en==0)
     endproperty

     assertion property (fifo_over_prevention) $display("Fifo over prevention is PASSED") else $display("Fifo over prevention is FAILED");
