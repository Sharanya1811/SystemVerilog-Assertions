Ensure that a round-robin arbiter grants access fairly:

If reqA is high but grantA is not given, then grantA must be given within the next 5 cycles if reqA is still high.
Same condition applies for reqB.

Ans:

    property arbiter_fairness_check;
    @(posedge clock)  disable iff(reset)
       (reqA ==1  && grantA==0) |-> #[1:5] grantA && (reqA==1) ;
    endproperty

   assert property(arbiter_fairness_check);
