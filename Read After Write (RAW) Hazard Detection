Ensure that a read operation does not happen immediately after a write to the same address in a dual-port RAM.
Assume:

wr_en, rd_en control write and read operations.
wr_addr, rd_addr specify the addresses

ANS::
    property RAW_Hazard;
    @(posedge clock) disable iff(reset)
     (wr_en==1) && (rd_en==0) |=> ((rd_en==1) && (rd_addr!= $past(wr_addr)));
    endproperty

    assert property (RAW_Hazard);
